1. Hypothesis: Route-Specific Decline in EPS
Observation: The EPS might have decreased on specific routes due to changes in demand or competition. Some routes might be less profitable due to new competitors or shifts in customer preferences.
Recommendation: Conduct a detailed analysis of the most significant routes by volume and profitability. Identify routes where EPS has significantly declined and investigate the causes. Consider adjusting pricing, offering promotions, or improving services on these routes to recapture market share.

2. Hypothesis: Impact of Vehicle Class on EPS
Observation: Certain vehicle classes may contribute less to EPS due to pricing strategies, increased competition, or changes in customer preferences. For example, lower-margin classes might be more popular, reducing overall profitability.
Recommendation: Analyze the EPS by vehicle class to identify which classes are underperforming. Consider introducing premium services or upselling strategies for higher-margin classes. Additionally, review the pricing strategy for less profitable classes and adjust accordingly to improve margins.

3. Hypothesis: Operator Performance and Customer Satisfaction
Observation: The performance of specific operators may have impacted EPS due to operational inefficiencies or lower customer satisfaction. Operators with lower performance might contribute to refunds, cancellations, or reduced repeat bookings.
Recommendation: Evaluate the performance of operators, focusing on those with declining EPS. Collaborate with underperforming operators to improve service quality, reduce operational inefficiencies, and enhance customer satisfaction. Implement a feedback loop to monitor improvements and adjust strategies as needed.
