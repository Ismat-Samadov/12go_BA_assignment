Hypotheses Based on the Analysis
Hypothesis 1: Station-Specific Decline

Observation: If certain from_id or to_id stations show a greater decline in EPS, it may indicate decreased demand or increased competition at these stations.
Recommendation: Investigate the reasons for decreased demand and consider targeted marketing or adjusting service offerings at these stations.
Hypothesis 2: Operator Performance

Observation: If certain operator_ids are underperforming, this could indicate operational inefficiencies or issues with customer satisfaction.
Recommendation: Work with underperforming operators to identify areas for improvement and enhance service quality.
Hypothesis 3: Impact of Vehicle Class

Observation: If certain vehicle classes, identified by class_name, are contributing to the decline in EPS, it may be due to pricing strategies or changes in customer preferences.
Recommendation: Consider adjusting pricing, adding value-added services, or promoting higher-margin vehicle classes.
Hypothesis 4: Country-Specific Trends

Observation: If from_country_id shows significant EPS differences, it might reflect changes in demand or competition in specific countries.
Recommendation: Tailor marketing efforts and pricing strategies to reflect regional differences in demand.
